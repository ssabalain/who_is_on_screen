# Who is on screen?

## About the project & documentation
"Who is on screen?" idea was born while watching several amounts of series and movies during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Questions like "Where have I seen this guy before?" or "Is this actress the same as the one we saw on that other movie?" started to arise 
more frequently, and I noticed that the traditional way of getting the answers was Googling the movie (with spoiler risk) and scrolling down
into long wikipedia articles,just to find an answer only in some cases.

But, what if it was possible to just type the movie name and the minute at where you are standing (which you are going to get while pausing the
show anyway) and have a list of all the actors being displayed at that specific moment? And maybe also show other works performed by those actors,
most recognized films, etc. That would be great, huh?

Well, there are two ways of doing that:

  1)  Hiring an army of cinephiles, tie them to a computer, make them watch countless movies and write down each actor that appears at a specic time,
      as well as when they are not being displayed anymore, or... 

  2)  Train a facial recognition model with actor's faces, and make it analyze movies, detect actors and register the moments they appear in a
      database.
      
For budgeting (and humanitary) reasons, I've decided to move on with the second option.

The main goal behind this project was to build a scalable solution that could easily adapt to different infrastructures, from a local enviroment up to 
a cloud deployment. For that reason, everything has been built up as a Docker solution. All files and documentation can be found in this [Github repo](https://github.com/ssabalain/who_is_on_screen)
